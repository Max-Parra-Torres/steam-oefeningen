API stands for “Application Programming Interface.” In simple terms,
it’s a set of rules and protocols that allow how different software applications can communicate and interact with each other.
APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
To retrieve data from a web server, a client application initiates a request, and the server responds with the requested data.
APIs facilitate this communication by serving as intermediaries, allowing seamless integration between diverse software systems.
In essence, APIs act as bridges that enable the smooth exchange of data and functionality,
enhancing interoperability across various applications.
