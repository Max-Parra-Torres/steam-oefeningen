Every request to a web server returns a status code indicating what happened with the request.
Here are some common codes relevant to GET requests:

200: Everything went okay, and the result has been returned (if any).

301: The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint.
This can happen when a company switches domain names, or an endpoint name is changed.

400: The server thinks you made a bad request.
This happens when you send incorrect data or make other client-side errors.

401: The server thinks you're not authenticated.
Many APIs require login credentials, so this happens when you don't send the right credentials to access an API.

403: The resource you're trying to access is forbidden: you don't have the right permissions to see it.

404: The resource you tried to access wasn't found on the server.

503: The server is not ready to handle the request.

Notice that all the codes starting with 4 indicate some sort of client-side error,
while 5xx codes point to server-side issues.
The first digit of the status code indicates its category.
Knowing this makes it easy to quickly identify if a request was successful (2xx) or if there was an error (4xx or 5xx).
